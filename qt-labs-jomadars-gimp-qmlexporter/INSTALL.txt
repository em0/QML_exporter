INSTALLATION
To use this plugin, make sure you have a recent version of GIMP 2 installed.

- Copy the file qmlexporter.py to ~/.gimp/plug-ins
- Run chmod u+rx on the file to make sure it is executable
- Run or restart gimp

The exporter should now show up at the bottom of the File menu.
When you run it, it will ask for the element name and the directory
to dump the output consisting of a .qml file and a series of .png files.

Note that names are preserved from your layer names, but # and space are
replaced by underscores to make them usable id tags. Offset, size, ordering
and opacity are currently preserved.
